**Date**: 2026-01-22

### Assignment:
Working exclusively on Feature #221: "Test Call form accepts fake property address"

   - `testState` - stores state

2. **Added "Fake Property Address" section:**
   - Label: "Fake Property Address"
   - Description explaining AI will reference the address during test conversation
   - Three input fields:
     - Street Address (full width) with placeholder "Street Address (e.g., 123 Main St)"
     - City (half width)
     - State (half width) with placeholder "State (e.g., TX)"
   - All fields use consistent purple focus ring styling
