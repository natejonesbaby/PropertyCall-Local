## SESSION: Single Feature Mode - Feature #34 (SUCCESS!)
**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Mode**: SINGLE FEATURE MODE - Assigned Feature #34 ONLY

### Assignment:
Working exclusively on Feature #34: "Prompts configuration persists across sessions"

### Feature Requirements (from feature steps):
1. Step 1: Navigate to Configuration > Prompts
2. Step 2: Edit system prompt to include 'UNIQUE_PROMPT_TEST_123'
3. Step 3: Save changes
4. Step 4: Refresh page
5. Step 5: Verify 'UNIQUE_PROMPT_TEST_123' appears in prompt
6. Step 6: Log out, log back in, verify persistence

### Implementation Status: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

The functionality to persist prompts configuration was already fully implemented:
- GET /api/config/prompts endpoint retrieves prompts from database
- PUT /api/config/prompts/:type endpoint saves prompts to database
- UI in frontend/src/pages/Configuration.jsx handles prompt editing and saving
- Prompts stored in backend/data/property_call.db in the prompts table

### Test Results:

**Browser UI Verification:**

| Step | Description | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Navigate to Configuration > Prompts | PASS - /config loads, AI Prompts tab clicked |
| 2 | Edit system prompt to include 'UNIQUE_PROMPT_TEST_123' | PASS - Changed prompt text |
| 3 | Save changes | PASS - "Prompts saved successfully" notification |
| 4 | Refresh page | PASS - F5 pressed, page reloaded |
| 5 | Verify 'UNIQUE_PROMPT_TEST_123' appears in prompt | PASS - Still visible after refresh |
| 6 | Log out, log back in, verify persistence | PASS - Prompt still shows UNIQUE_PROMPT_TEST_123 |

**Database Verification:**
- Confirmed in backend/data/property_call.db prompts table
- System prompt content: "UNIQUE_PROMPT_TEST_123 - You are a helpful real estate AI assistant..."
- updated_at timestamp: "2026-01-22 13:08:42" (today)
- All 4 prompt types stored: system, greeting, goodbye, voicemail

**Console Errors:** None

### Feature #34: PASSED

All 6 verification steps confirmed. The prompts configuration is properly persisted in the SQLite database and survives page refreshes and user logout/login cycles.

### Session Statistics:
- Passing: 200 (previously 199)
- In Progress: 0 (previously 1)
- Total: 207
- Completion: 96.6% (increased from 96.1%)

### Git Commit:
- Commit hash: dd6b386
- Message: "Implement Feature #34: Prompts configuration persists across sessions"

### Files Verified (no changes needed):
- frontend/src/pages/Configuration.jsx - Prompts UI implementation
- backend/src/routes/config.js - Prompts API endpoints
- backend/src/db/setup.js - Prompts database schema

### Files Created:
- check-prompts-db.js - Database verification script

### Screenshots Captured:
- feature-34-prompts-persist-across-sessions.png - AI Prompts page showing UNIQUE_PROMPT_TEST_123

### Notes:
- The feature was already completely implemented
- No code changes were required
- All persistence mechanisms work correctly (database storage, API endpoints, UI state management)
- The feature demonstrates good data integrity with proper timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
