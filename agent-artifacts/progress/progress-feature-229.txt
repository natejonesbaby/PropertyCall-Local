## SESSION: Single Feature Mode - Feature #229 (SUCCESS!)
**Date**: 2026-01-23
**Mode**: SINGLE FEATURE MODE - Assigned Feature #229 ONLY

### Assignment:
Working exclusively on Feature #229: "Test Call verifies API integrations before starting"

### Feature Requirements (from feature steps):
1. Step 1: Remove or invalidate one API key (e.g., Telnyx)
2. Step 2: Try to initiate a test call
3. Step 3: Verify error message indicates which integration is missing/invalid
4. Step 4: Configure all required API keys
5. Step 5: Verify test call can now be initiated

### Implementation:

**Files Modified:**

1. **backend/src/routes/calls.js**
   - Added API key validation before test call initiation
   - Checks for Telnyx, Deepgram, and OpenAI API keys
   - Returns detailed error response with `missing` and `invalid` arrays
   - Error message specifies exactly which integrations are missing/invalid

2. **frontend/src/pages/Configuration.jsx**
   - Added `testCallErrorDetails` state for detailed error info
   - Enhanced error display to show "API Integration Error" title
   - Shows bulleted list of missing API keys
   - Shows bulleted list of invalid API keys
   - Added "Configure API Keys" button for quick navigation to settings

### Backend Validation Logic:
- Check Telnyx API key - required for telephony
- Check Deepgram API key - required for voice AI STT/TTS
- Check OpenAI API key - required for voice AI LLM
- Validate OpenAI key format (must start with sk-)

### Verification Results:

| Step | Description | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Remove or invalidate one API key | PASS - Removed Deepgram API key |
| 2 | Try to initiate a test call | PASS - Clicked "Start Test Call" |
| 3 | Verify error message indicates missing integration | PASS - Shows "Missing API Keys: Deepgram" |
| 4 | Configure all required API keys | PASS - Added back Deepgram key |
| 5 | Verify test call can now be initiated | PASS - Call ID 61 initiated |
