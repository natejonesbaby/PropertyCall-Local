### Notes:
- The test call feature works correctly with the mock Telnyx server
- With real Telnyx credentials, this would actually ring the user's phone
- The backend properly handles:
  - Queue pause checking
  - Active call detection (prevents concurrent calls)
  - Telnyx API key validation
  - Test lead creation and cleanup
