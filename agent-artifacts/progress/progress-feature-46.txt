## SESSION: Single Feature Mode - Feature #46 (SUCCESS!)
**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Mode**: SINGLE FEATURE MODE - Assigned Feature #46 ONLY

### Assignment:
Working exclusively on Feature #46: "Form validation prevents empty required fields"

### Feature Requirements (from feature steps):
1. Step 1: Navigate to Registration page
2. Step 2: Leave email empty, try to submit
3. Step 3: Verify error shown for email field
4. Step 4: Navigate to Configuration > Questions
5. Step 5: Try to add question with empty text
6. Step 6: Verify error prevents submission

### Implementation Status: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

The form validation functionality was already fully implemented in both forms:

**Registration Form (frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx):**
- HTML5 `required` attribute on all fields (email, password, confirmPassword)
- Custom validation messages displayed below fields
- Field-level validation on blur (handleEmailBlur, handlePasswordBlur, handleConfirmPasswordBlur)
- Submit-level validation showing all errors at once
- Email format validation with regex
- Password length validation (minimum 8 characters)
- Password matching validation

**Questions Form (frontend/src/pages/Configuration.jsx):**
- JavaScript-based validation with `.trim()` check
- Submit button dynamically disabled when input is empty or whitespace-only
- Additional server-side validation in backend
- Clear visual feedback with disabled state styling
- Code: `if (!newQuestion.trim() || submitting) return;`
- Button disabled attribute: `disabled={!newQuestion.trim() || submitting}`

### Test Results:

**Browser UI Verification:**

| Step | Description | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Navigate to Registration page | PASS - http://localhost:5173/register loaded |
| 2 | Leave email empty, try to submit | PASS - Filled password fields, clicked submit with empty email |
| 3 | Verify error shown for email field | PASS - HTML5 validation working: has `required` attribute, validation message "Please fill out this field.", field marked invalid |
| 4 | Navigate to Configuration > Questions | PASS - Logged in and navigated to Configuration > Qualifying Questions |
| 5 | Try to add question with empty text | PASS - Tested multiple scenarios: empty input (button disabled), whitespace only (button disabled), with text (button enabled) |
| 6 | Verify error prevents submission | PASS - Submit button disabled when empty, prevents form submission |

**Detailed Validation Tests:**
- Empty email field: HTML5 validation triggered ✅
- Email field with spaces: Browser shows validation message ✅
- Empty question input: Submit button disabled ✅
- Question input with spaces only: Submit button disabled (`.trim()` check) ✅
- Question input with text: Submit button enabled ✅

**Console Errors:** None

### Feature #46: PASSED ✅

All 6 verification steps confirmed. Form validation is working correctly on both the Registration form and the Questions form using appropriate validation strategies (HTML5 + custom errors for registration, JavaScript button disabling for questions).

### Session Statistics:

- feature-46-step4-questions-form-empty.png - Questions form with disabled button (empty input)

### Notes:
- The feature was already completely implemented
- No code changes were required
- Both forms use different but equally effective validation strategies
- Registration form: HTML5 validation + custom error messages
- Questions form: JavaScript-based button disabling with `.trim()` check
- All validation properly prevents submission of empty required fields
- Excellent user experience with clear visual feedback
