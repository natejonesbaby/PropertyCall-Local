## SESSION: Single Feature Mode - Feature #208 (SKIPPED)
**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Mode**: SINGLE FEATURE MODE - Assigned Feature #208 ONLY

### Assignment:
Working exclusively on Feature #208: "Dock app launches and appears in Mac dock"

### Feature Requirements (from feature steps):
1. Step 1: Double-click the Property Call app in Applications folder or Finder
2. Step 2: Verify the app icon appears in the Mac dock
3. Step 3: Verify the app shows as a running application (dot under icon)

### Analysis:
This feature tests **native Mac desktop application** functionality, but Property Call is a **web application** built with:
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (runs in browser)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (runs as server)
- No Electron or native app wrapper exists

### Why This Feature Cannot Be Implemented:

1. **Project Specification Conflict:**
   - The app_spec.txt clearly describes a web application architecture
   - Technology stack is React frontend + Express backend
   - No mention of desktop app, Electron, or native Mac app anywhere
   - The app is accessed via browser at localhost:5173 (dev) or production URL

2. **Missing Infrastructure:**
   - No Electron dependencies in package.json
   - No .app bundle in the project
   - No desktop-related configuration files
   - No app icon resources for Mac app

3. **Fundamental Architecture Mismatch:**
   - Web apps don't appear in Applications folder
   - Web apps don't show dock icons (browsers do)
   - Web apps don't have "running" indicators in the dock

### Resolution:
Feature #208 has been SKIPPED because it tests functionality outside the project scope. This is a web application, not a native Mac desktop application.

If a desktop app experience is desired in the future, it would require:
1. Adding Electron as a dependency
2. Creating main process and preload scripts
3. Building app icon assets
4. Configuring electron-builder for Mac packaging
5. This would be a significant new feature, not a test of existing functionality

### Session Statistics:
- Feature #208: SKIPPED (moved to end of queue)
- Reason: Outside project scope - web app cannot have Mac dock integration

### Notes:
- No code changes made
- No commits needed
- Feature moved to end of priority queue (12511)
