## SESSION: Single Feature Mode - Feature #198 (SUCCESS!)
**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Mode**: SINGLE FEATURE MODE - Assigned Feature #198 ONLY

### Assignment:
Working exclusively on Feature #198: "Call history filterable by outcome"

### Feature Requirements (from feature steps):
1. Apply filter for 'Qualified'
2. Verify only qualified calls shown
3. Apply filter for 'Voicemail Left'
4. Verify only voicemail calls shown

### Implementation Status: 100% COMPLETE (Already Implemented)

The filtering functionality was already fully implemented in the codebase. The verification confirmed:

1. **Frontend CallHistory.jsx** (`frontend/src/pages/CallHistory.jsx`):
   - `filters` state includes `qualification_status` and `disposition` (lines 158-164)
   - Dropdown selects for Qualification Status (lines 633-643) and Disposition (lines 644-661)
   - `handleFilterChange` function updates filters and resets pagination (lines 257-260)
   - `fetchCalls` function passes filters to API as query params (lines 197-206)

2. **Backend API** (`backend/src/routes/calls.js`):
   - GET `/api/calls` endpoint accepts `qualification_status` and `disposition` query params (line 85)
   - Filters are applied to WHERE clause (lines 101-109)
   - Database query returns only matching calls

### Test Results:

**Browser UI Verification:**

**Step 1 and 2: Filter for "Qualified"**
- Selected "Qualified" from Qualification Status dropdown
- Table shows only 10 calls with "Qualified" outcome
- All other qualification statuses hidden

**Step 3 and 4: Filter for "Voicemail Left"**
