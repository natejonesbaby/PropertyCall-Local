# AGENTS.md

This file is for coding agents (and humans) to quickly understand how to work in this repo.

## Goals

- Make it easy to **install**, **test**, and **ship** changes
- Keep commands consistent for automation and CI

## Project Commands

Fill these in and keep them updated:

- Install: `{{INSTALL_COMMAND}}`
- Test: `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`
- Lint: `{{LINT_COMMAND}}`
- Format: `{{FORMAT_COMMAND}}`
- Dev/run: `{{DEV_COMMAND}}`
- Build: `{{BUILD_COMMAND}}`

## Repo Expectations

- There is a single obvious way to run tests (e.g. `make test`, `npm test`, `poetry run pytest`).
- CI runs the same commands as local development.
- CONTRIBUTING.md explains the workflow.

## Agent Backlog

If `AGENT_BACKLOG.md` exists, address those items first.
